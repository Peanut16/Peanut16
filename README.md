I’m a computer science student with a passion for creating things that make learning, gaming, and technology more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. I love exploring the intersection of creativity and logic.

I’ve worked with tools like React, Django, and AWS, and I’m always experimenting with new ways to bring ideas to life. Recently, I’ve been building:

- 🌐 Web apps that connect serverless backends with modern UIs

### 💡 What Drives Me
